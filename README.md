# TriviaGame
Civil War trivia game.
A total of 10 questions must be completed before 60 seconds. 
Once your time runs out you will receive an alert. 
The alert will also tell you how many questions you selected correctly.
To start the game/timer you must click on the start button that is on the jumbotron.
The timer is located in a span in th paragraph tag with a id of countdownTimer. The timer starts at 60 seconds and counts down.
If you complete all questions before the time runs out, please click the submit button.
I decided to have all the questions on one page to make it easier for the user to skip around. If i were to have a question appear one at a time i would use (.fadeIn .fadeOut .hide) in a function. 
The trivia questions were found on multiple Civil War game websites.
